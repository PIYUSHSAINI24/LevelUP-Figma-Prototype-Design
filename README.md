# LevelUP – Health & Fitness App for Busy Students

LevelUP is a **student-focused wellness and productivity prototype**, designed during the **Design Thinking & Figma Summer Training Internship** at Lovely Professional University. The project addresses a major problem faced by college students: maintaining a healthy lifestyle alongside tight schedules, academic stress, and lack of motivation.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Students often skip meals, avoid workouts, drink less water, and face high stress due to academic pressure. Existing fitness apps are either **time-consuming**, **complex**, or **not designed for students**.

LevelUP provides:
- Quick, no-equipment workouts  
- Simple nutrition guidance  
- Hydration reminders  
- Habit and streak tracking  
- Gamified wellness experience  

Designed using **Design Thinking methodology** and prototyped in **Figma**, LevelUP makes fitness practical, engaging, and achievable.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Busy college students struggle to stay healthy due to **lack of time, motivation, and guidance**, leading to poor diet, inactivity, dehydration, stress, and declining well-being. LevelUP provides a **quick, engaging, and student-friendly** solution to fit health into daily routines.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand fitness and nutrition challenges among students  
- Design a simple health & fitness solution  
- Apply Design Thinking framework  
- Build a functional prototype using Figma  
- Improve student wellness motivation through gamification  

---

## 🧠 Design Thinking Process

### 1️⃣ Empathize  
Surveys, interviews, and observations conducted with students to understand real struggles like skipping meals, no time for workouts, low hydration, and stress.

### 2️⃣ Define  
Clear problem framed: students want to stay healthy but lack time, motivation, and simple tools.

### 3️⃣ Ideate  
Brainstormed and shortlisted impactful features such as mini workouts, meal tips, water tracker, streaks, and challenges.

### 4️⃣ Prototype  
Designed **low-fidelity wireframes** followed by **high-fidelity interactive screens** in Figma.

### 5️⃣ Test  
Usability testing conducted with 15+ students; feedback used to refine design and features.
